## Limit usage of property setters

Prefer explicit set/get functions (e.g. `setBar` and `getBar` functions) over setters/getters.

Consider the following code:

```ts
foo.bar = {
  a: 123,
  b: 456,
};
```

In the presence of setter/getters:

```ts
class Foo {
  a: number;
  b: number;
  set bar(value: { a: number; b: number }) {
    this.a = value.a;
    this.b = value.b;
  }
}
let foo = new Foo();
```

This is not a _good_ use of property setters. The person reading the first code sample has no context about all the things that will change. Whereas someone calling `foo.setBar(value)` might have an idea that something might change on `foo`.

> Bonus points: Find references works better if you have different functions. In TypeScript tools if you find references for a getter or a setter you get _both_ whereas with explicit function calls you only get references to the relevant function.
