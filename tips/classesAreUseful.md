## Classes Are Useful

It is very common to have the following structure:

```ts
function foo() {
  let someProperty;

  // Some other initialization code

  function someMethod() {
    // Do some stuff with `someProperty`
    // And potentially other things
  }
  // Maybe some other methods

  return {
    someMethod,
    // Maybe some other methods
  };
}
```

This is known as the _revealing module pattern_ and quite common in JavaScript (taking advantage of JavaScript closure).

If you use [_file modules_ (which you really should as global scope is bad)](../project/modules.md) then _your file is effectively the same_. However, there are too many cases where people will write code like the following:

```ts
let someProperty;

function foo() {
  // Some initialization code
}
foo(); // some initialization code

someProperty = 123; // some more initialization

// Some utility function not exported

// later
export function someMethod() {}
```

Even though I am not a big fan of inheritance _I do find that letting people use classes helps them organize their code better_. The same developer would intuitively write the following:

```ts
class Foo {
  public someProperty;

  constructor() {
    // some initialization
  }

  public someMethod() {
    // some code
  }

  private someUtility() {
    // some code
  }
}

export = new Foo();
```

And its not just developers, creating dev tools that provide great visualizations over classes are much more common, and there is one less pattern your team needs to understand and maintain.

> PS: There is nothing wrong in my opinion with _shallow_ class hierarchies if they provide significant reuse and reduction in boiler plate.
