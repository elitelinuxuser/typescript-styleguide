# Function Parameters

If you have a function that takes too many parameters, or parameters of the same type, then you might want to consider changing the function to take an object instead.

Consider the following function:

```ts
function foo(flagA: boolean, flagB: boolean) {
  // your awesome function body
}
```

With such a function definition it's quite easy to invoke it incorrectly e.g. `foo(flagB, flagA)` and you would get no help from the compiler.

Instead, convert the function to take an object:

```ts
function foo(config: { flagA: boolean; flagB: boolean }) {
  const { flagA, flagB } = config;
  // your awesome function body
}
```

Now the function calls will look like `foo({flagA, flagB})` which makes it much easier to spot mistakes and code review.

> Note : If your function is simple enough, and you don't expect much churn, then feel free to ignore this advice.
